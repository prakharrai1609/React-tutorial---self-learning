- If using in strict mode, react dom renders 2 times. If not, its rendering 1 time.

- How to use useState hook? (understanding till now)
    - For ex. `const [count, set] = useState(0)`
    - If we write this ^, it means we are declaring a variable similar to a static variable and we are able to render it in real time.
    - Value inside `useState(___)` is the initial value given to the count.
